# Water-Sensor

I created a project to measure the water level of our watertank in our basement, if there is a malfunction with the water pump I get a notification on email and smartphone so I can intervene and prevent the flooding of the basement.

I used an ESP32 to connect my analog watersensor to a Blynk server and with the blynk app I can view the water level on my smartphone.
If there is flooding danger an alarm will go off wich i can turn on/off and control the frequency on my smartphone using the blynk app.
